# üéØ **FOUND THE ROOT CAUSE!**

## ‚ùå **The Problem**

In `src/configs/env.ts`, the SMTP email configuration was using **default values**:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (PROBLEMATIC)
export const EMAIL_USER = process.env.EMAIL_USER || "";  // Empty string default
export const EMAIL_PASS = process.env.EMAIL_PASS || "";  // Empty string default
```

This means:
- Even without environment variables, `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` exist as empty strings
- The EmailService sees them as "configured" (not null/undefined)
- It tries to use SMTP with empty credentials ‚Üí "535 Authentication Credentials Invalid"

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

Changed to:

```typescript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
export const EMAIL_USER = process.env.EMAIL_USER;  // undefined if not set
export const EMAIL_PASS = process.env.EMAIL_PASS;  // undefined if not set
```

Now:
- If no SMTP environment variables are set, `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are `undefined`
- EmailService skips SMTP and uses AWS SES instead
- No more authentication errors!

## üîÑ **Email Service Priority (After Fix)**

1. SendGrid: ‚ùå Not configured
2. Mailgun: ‚ùå Not configured  
3. **AWS SES: ‚úÖ Will be used** ‚Üê Perfect!
4. SMTP: ‚ùå Not configured (no more defaults)

## üöÄ **How to Apply**

The fix is already in the code. You need to **deploy this change** to your AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

1. **Commit and push** this change to your repository
2. **Deploy** to Elastic Beanstalk 
3. **Or manually update** the `env.ts` file on your server

## üß™ **Test Result**

After deployment, your OTP registration will work because:
- ‚úÖ AWS SES will be used (no SMTP interference)
- ‚úÖ No more "535 Authentication Credentials Invalid" errors
- ‚úÖ Emails sent successfully via AWS SES

This was a classic case of **default values interfering** with proper email provider selection!
