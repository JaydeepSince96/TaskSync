# 🚨 CRITICAL PORT BINDING FIX

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your server was binding to `localhost:8080` instead of `0.0.0.0:8080`, which means:
- ✅ Application runs perfectly
- ✅ MongoDB connects successfully  
- ✅ All services initialize
- ❌ **Server only accessible from within EC2 instance**
- ❌ **External requests get 503 errors**

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

Changed in `src/app.ts`:
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Only accessible locally)
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);

// AFTER (✅ Accessible externally)
app.listen(Number(PORT), '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server running at http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
```

## 📦 **Deployment Package**

**File**: `port-binding-fix.zip`
- ✅ Contains the port binding fix
- ✅ Ready for immediate deployment

## 🚀 **Deploy Now**

### **Step 1: Upload to Elastic Beanstalk**
1. **Go to AWS Console → Elastic Beanstalk**
2. **Select your environment** (TaskSync-env)
3. **Click "Upload and Deploy"**
4. **Upload**: `port-binding-fix.zip`
5. **Click "Deploy"**

### **Step 2: Wait for Deployment**
- **Deployment time**: 2-5 minutes
- **Watch the logs** for successful startup

### **Step 3: Verify Fix**
After deployment, you should see in logs:
```
🚀 Server running at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

## ✅ **Expected Results**

After deployment:
- ✅ `https://api.tasksync.org/api/health` → 200 OK
- ✅ `https://tasksync.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/health` → 200 OK
- ✅ CORS issues resolved
- ✅ User registration working
- ✅ All API endpoints accessible

## 🔍 **Why This Happened**

- **Development**: `localhost` works fine
- **Production**: Elastic Beanstalk needs `0.0.0.0` to accept external connections
- **Load Balancer**: Can't reach `localhost`, only `0.0.0.0`

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy immediately** - This is the root cause of all 503 errors
2. **Test registration** - Should work after deployment
3. **Monitor logs** - Ensure server binds to `0.0.0.0:8080`

**This fix will resolve ALL the 503 errors and CORS issues!** 🎉
